# Equilibrium-Earth-Take-Home-Task
 Development of a Python-based workflow to automatically screen land parcels using recent satellite imagery. The goal is to identify parcels that are suitable for a potential afforestation/reforestation project by ensuring they are clear of significant existing forest cover.

 Though the option was given to complete the task in either GEE (Part 2A) or python open source libraries(Part 2B). I have done it in both methods. 


# It is Highly Recommonded to download the .ipynb files first and then inspect or go-through the file.
since gitHub will show 'Invalid ipynb'
